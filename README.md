# Car_Price_Prediction


Car Price Prediction Model
Car price prediction is a significant application of machine learning, where the goal is to predict the price of a car based on various factors such as brand reputation, features, horsepower, mileage, and more. This project provides a guide on how to train a car price prediction model using machine learning techniques.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains information about different cars, including their brand, model, year of manufacture, selling price, present price, kilometers driven, fuel type, selling type, transmission, and owner details. The dataset is preprocessed to handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and normalize numerical features.

Model Training
The project involves training a regression model to predict car prices based on the features provided in the dataset. 
The trained models are evaluated using common regression metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared score. These metrics help assess the accuracy and effectiveness of the models in predicting car prices.


Repository Contents
Notebooks: Jupyter notebooks containing code for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
Data: CSV files containing the dataset used for training and testing the models.
README.md: Instructions on how to run the code and reproduce the results.

Getting Started
To get started with this project, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Run the Jupyter notebooks to preprocess the data, train the models, and evaluate their performance.
Experiment with different regression algorithms and hyperparameters to improve the model's accuracy.
Deploy the trained model in a production environment for real-world use cases.
